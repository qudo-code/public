Moments captured during my trip to NYC.  
  
Every mint is a unique way of exploring my trip no one has experienced yet. Let me know what you find!  
  
Each NFT is a fully interactive photo editing app where users can select from a list of photos and adjust various image effects.  
  
Initial photo and edit settings are determined based on mint address of that NFT. This means that all of them will have a unique starting state.
