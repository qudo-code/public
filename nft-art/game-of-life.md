The Game of Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.  
  
Each piece minted generates its initial layout based on its mint address which provides a unique experience for each NFT in the collection.  
  
The goal of the game is to create stable life. Many shapes don't decay and remain static or toggle between multiple states in an infinite loop.  
  
An empty, or “dead,” cell with precisely three “live” neighbors (full cells) becomes live.  
  
A live cell with zero or one neighbors dies of isolation; a live cell with four or more neighbors dies of overcrowding.  
  
A live cell with two or three neighbors remains alive.  
  
You can place up to 10 cells.
